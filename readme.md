# **Ayuda - Digital Wallet for FIAT & Crypto**
🚀 *Work in Progress*

## **📌 Overview**
Ayuda is a **modern digital wallet** that enables users to securely store, transfer, and manage both **FIAT** and **crypto assets (Solana tokens)**. The platform also provides users with **virtual and physical cards**, ensuring a seamless transaction experience.

### **Key Features**
- 💰 **E-wallet** for FIAT and Solana tokens
- 🔄 **Send & Receive Money** within the platform
- 🏦 **Deposit & Withdraw Funds** via bank transfers & crypto wallets
- 💳 **Virtual & Physical Cards** for online/offline payments
- ⚡ **Secure Authentication** using JWT & Bcrypt for password hashing
- 🔒 **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for secure transactions
- 🔔 **In-App & Email Notifications**
- 🚀 **Microservices Architecture** for scalability

## **🔧 Setup Instructions**

### **1️⃣ Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [JDK 17+](https://adoptium.net/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)
- [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional)

---

### **2️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ayuda.git
cd ayuda
```

---

### **3️⃣ Configuration**

#### **🔑 Environment Variables**
Each microservice requires environment variables to be properly configured. The **recommended approach** is to use **environment variables** rather than `.env` files in production.

Set environment variables for your services:
```sh
export CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your-cloudinary-cloud-name"
export CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your-cloudinary-api-key"
export CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your-cloudinary-api-secret"
export JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key"
```

Alternatively, if using `.env` for **development**, create a `.env` file inside each service:
```
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloudinary-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-cloudinary-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-cloudinary-api-secret
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

---

### **4️⃣ Running Services Locally**
Each microservice can be run separately.

#### **Run User Service**
```sh
cd user-service
mvn spring-boot:run
```

#### **Run Authentication Service**
```sh
cd authentication-service
mvn spring-boot:run
```

#### **Run Wallet Service**
```sh
cd wallet-service
mvn spring-boot:run
```

To **run all services together**, use **Docker Compose**:
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## **⚙️ Architecture**
### **Microservices Communication**
- **Synchronous Communication**: Services communicate via **Feign Clients** (HTTP REST).
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Services use **RabbitMQ** for event-driven interactions.

### **Security**
- **JWT-Based Authentication**
- **Bcrypt Password Hashing**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
